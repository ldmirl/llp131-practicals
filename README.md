### Syllabus

This syllabus is approximate -- the lectures may occur in a slightly different order and some topics may end up taking more time than expected.

- [Session 00 - Primers](./session00_primers/)
- [Session 01 - Model-Based](./session01_model_based/)
- [Session 02 - Model-Free](./session02_model_free/)
- [Session 03 - Approximation](./session03_approx/)


### Assessment Codebases

You may use one of the following codebases as a starting point for your coding assesment:

- [Overcooked-AI](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai)
- [MiniGrid](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Minigrid)
  * __NOTE__: Will require some environmental changes before Human-AI can be utilised with this library
- [Pacman w/ Feedback](https://github.com/Abhiramon/Pacman_RL_with_feedback)
  * __NOTE__: Will require some updates from Python2 to Python3. This will not work out of the box, as Python2 is now deprecated. You will need to modify Python2 syntax to Python3 see [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html) or make the changes manually see [Python3 to Python3 Cheat-Sheet](https://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html)
